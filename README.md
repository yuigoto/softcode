> A narrow monospaced font for coding, still vert WIP and not ready for regular use.

![Font Example](example.png)

I'm not a pro graphic/type designer, so it might look messy and ugly while I learn the hangs of type design.

The project's glyphs were built in **Inkscape** then imported into **FontForge**. While I used auto-hinting because of laziness, some characters might have manual hinting to look better under small sizes.

You may see that the characters aren't perfectly grid-aligned on the SVG files, and that's to help with hinting them on small sizes too, and to avoid weird looking characters when exporting to OTF format specially.

# TODO

> Gotta review this list ASAP.

- [x] Base characters, rough version;
- [ ] Improve characters;
- [ ] Add more characters;
- [ ] Add bitmap characters for small sizes (maybe, if I don't get hinting right);
- [ ] More languages support (who knows?);
